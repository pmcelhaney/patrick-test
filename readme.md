# The Patrick Test

Way back in 2000, before the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org),
Joel Spolsky created the [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/),
a 12 point evaluation of how mature a team's software development practices are.
It's held up very well.
Every point is still relevant, and almost every team still has room to improve.

The Patrick Test is an addendum to the Joel Test,
covering ideals that simply did not exist in 2000
as well as a few personal preferences.
A team's Patrick Test score is equal to
its score on the Joel test
plus one point for each question below they can answer affirmatively.

1. Do you use a distributed version control system (e.g. Git)?
2. Is your workflow built around [pull requests](https://www.madetech.com/blog/deployment-by-pull-requests)?
3. Do you have a straightforward policy for when it is permissible to depend on open source code?
4. Are developers allowed to contribute back to open source (when it's related to the job and not proprietary)?
5. Are developers allowed to contribute to open source on their own time?
6. Is the most commonly used communication system something other than email (e.g. [Slack](http://slack.com))?
7. Does Management / Information Security embrace "the Cloud" as an integral part of its IT infrastructure in the near term?
8. Are developers allowed to use Macs?
9. Are developers encouraged to spend some time working on projects that interest them, at least once a month (e.g. "20% time")?
10. Do you measure [cycle time](https://hakanforss.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/lean-lego-the-red-brick-cancer/)?
11. Do you practice Test-Driven Development?
12. Do you have automated acceptance tests that are understandable to non-technical product owners?
